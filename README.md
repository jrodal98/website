# Personal Portfolio and Resume

## Portfolio

I created my website with the help of bootstrap studio, which simplified the templating.  Currently, my website is located [here](https://www.jrodal.com/).

## Resume

My resume is based on a template released under the MIT license that I found [here](https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv).  A copy of my resume can be found [here](docs/resume.pdf).
