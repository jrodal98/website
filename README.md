## Portfolio

My portfolio is based on a template released under the MIT license that I found [here](https://github.com/mmacneil/devfolio).  I made a few modifications, such as adding a Github activity tracker and a skills sections, that you might be interested in as well.  Currently, my website is located [here](https://www.jrodal.dev/).
