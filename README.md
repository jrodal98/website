# Personal Portfolio and Resume

## Portfolio

My portfolio is based on a template released under the MIT license that I found [here](https://github.com/mmacneil/devfolio).  I made a few modifications, such as adding a Github activity tracker and a skills sections, that you might be interested in as well.  Currently, my website is located [here](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jr6ff/).

## Resume

My resume is based on a template released under the MIT license that I found [here](https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv).  A copy of my resume can be found [here](docs/Resume.pdf).

## Githooks

If you're copying my setup, you may also be interested in my `pre-push` githook, which pushes my portfolio to the UVA server where my website is hosted and my resume to Dropbox.  Run `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` to "enable" the `pre-push` githook and then edit the `pre-push` executable as desired.
